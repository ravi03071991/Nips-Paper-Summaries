#### Link: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7073-selective-classification-for-deep-neural-networks.pdf

**Summary** : This paper proposes a new method to construct a selective classifier for a given trained DNN. At test time the classifier rejects instances as needed to grant the desired risk. Performance is measured on ImageNet, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 datasets.
